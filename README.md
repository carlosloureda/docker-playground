# Docker Playground [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carlosloureda/docker-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carlosloureda/docker-playground)

What we have here is our first application built with Docker & CI/CD for deploying to
AWS and tested over TravisCI.

It will serve as a documentation app (I have all the documentation in my **Notion.so** docs, so if you need it ask me and I will get you a copy) for future work on bigger applications that will follow this approaches and so we get into the **noops** world.
